# INTRODUCTION
In this project, we want to construct a music style converter that can use machine learning algorithms to perform style conversions for the input  MIDI music.  We chose jazz music as a goal of conversion. The overall thinking is as follows:

First, select 800 jazz to build the original data set, and divide the data set into three parts: 

train: 600

 dev:50

 test:150

 Then, use music21 to extract information from the original MIDI song and retrieve its track information to save in the txt file.

Next, for the track information in each txt file, split it and get the chord and note sperately, save these two information in different files. This step is done for all folders. Finally we get six files: 

train.chord, train.note, dev.chord, dev.note, test.chord, test.note.
